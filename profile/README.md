## Systems Biology of Gene Regulatory Elements

We work with high-throughput sequencing data to learn about gene expression in time and space and combine this knowledge to decode how genomes encode information at all levels, from basic mechanisms of gene expression to organismal or disease phenotypes.

### miRNAs

A lot of work by present and former lab members has been -- and continues to be -- focused on small RNAs, most importantly miRNAs.
